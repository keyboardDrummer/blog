### Theory
Any recurring single-seat vote will stabilize towards two parties, well known groups of affiliated people, becoming popular and every election being won by someone from either of those parties.

The above holds regardless of what voting system is used.

### Argument
In a single-seat voting situation, voters should not blindly vote for their favorite candidate. If the candidate I vote on does not win, my vote is wasted, so I should vote on a candidate that I both like and has a chance of winning: what we generally call "voting tactically". To vote tactically I must know what the chances are of candidates winning, which I can do by looking at past election results and seeing how the current candidates are affiliated with past winners. However, the past election results were also determined by tactical votes. This creates a feedback loop that stabilises when only two popular parties remain.

To demonstrate that a two popular party state is the stable one, let's look at different situations and see whether they're stable.
1. Only the top party has a high chance to win: voting tactically is not possible since the winner is already clear, so voters can simply vote their favorite party. This means that current popular opinion determines the winner, which due to recent events might be a different party then the one that was predicted to win, so this situation is not stable. It is possible that one party has a slam dunk victory and will be expected to win the next election as well, in which case we end up in situation 1 again. However, it is also possible that one party wins but not slam dunk, in which case we end up in a different situation.
2. Only the first and second most popular parties have a chance to win. Here tactical voting is possible by voting either the first or second party. Current popular opinion determines which of the two parties wins. Since all tactical votes go to either one of the two parties, next election they will be considered likely to win again, so this situation is stable.
3. Three parties all have 33% chance to win. Here I can vote tactically on either of the three parties. Popular opinion will determine which party wins, and which party gets the second highest amount of votes. In the next election, the parties that got first and second place in this election will have a higher chance to win than the party who got third place, so this situation is not stable. Note that it moves towards situation 2.

### Consequences
Assuming that we want to give voters more than a binary choice when voting, we must not vote for single-seats.

### Alternatives
If we allow votes to be recast at any time, voters do not have to refer to past election results to determine how to vote tactically. They can simply vote their favorite candidate and change their vote if it turns out the vote was wasted.
